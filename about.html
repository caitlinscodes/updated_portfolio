    <p>
      Howdy, and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio! 
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Caitlin Stevenson and I am an experienced professional transitioning into the web development field.
      With over ten years spent in both the for-profit and non-profit sectors I have acquired a number of soft skills that I feel will help me throughout the course of my career transition.
      I am excited and looking forward to finding a position as a Full Stack Developer following the completion of my bootcamp.
